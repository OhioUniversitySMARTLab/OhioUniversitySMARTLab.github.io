The Social Media Analytics Research Team (SMART) has been established as an interdisciplinary laboratory to foster and promote cutting-edge research. The SMART Lab is based in the Scripps College of Communication at Ohio University. Founded in 2015, the aim of the SMART Lab is to further enhance our understanding of online user behavior in online communities, and predict future outcomes. 

Rapid technological change has led to the generation of vast amounts of data that holds immense value and has the potential to provide meaningful insights. When captured, understood and visualized, such data can help solve problems being faced by organizations and businesses and enable them to better serve their communities, enhance their brands, and build stronger relationships. Social media analytics research is exciting and applies in areas such as Health Communication, Politics, Business, Psychology, Computer Science, and Journalism. 

Human behavior in online communities can be better understood through a range of analytics tools by extracting hidden patterns and information. We use both qualitative and quantitative research methods to provide solutions for complex problems facing organizations and businesses.
